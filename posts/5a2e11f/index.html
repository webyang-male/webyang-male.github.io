<pre class="language-none"><code class="language-none">The 21st century has witnessed dramatic changes, bringing about fresh challenges to be
solved every day. For students, meeting challenges is the new normal when they enter the
society. Therefore, we must develop adequate abilities to deal with challenges.
Firstly, when meeting challenges, students have the ability to address them effectively.
For example, they try to improve themselves by working harder, so as not to be defeated
once the challenges appear in their life. Moreover, challenge is a vital source of inspiration
and creative power. If you find something challenging and you’ve decided to face it, you are
determined to devote all your energies to collecting new information in order to accomplish
the task. During this process, fresh knowledge and innovative ideas will come to mind
constantly, which will definitely freshen up your perception. Thus, the ability to meet
challenges can be recognized as a contributing factor to a creative mind.
In conclusion, we students should cultivate our abilities to meet various challenges of
society so that we will better adapt to the rapid social development, and the ability will also
exert an ever-lasting influence upon our future study.
【参考范文 2 】 ：
Develop Our Ability to Meet Challenges
Obviously, in this highly competitive society, fostering students’ ability to meet
challenges is gaining greater importance.
First of all, challenges are inevitable in life. Due to the quickening pace of the current
society, college students are being exposed to diverse kinds of challenges and pressures.
Hence, students are expected to equip themselves with the ability to cope with challenges.
Otherwise, it will be difficult for them to gain a foothold after entering the society. Secondly,
challenges are opportunities to grow. If students can learn to face challenges—even if they
end in failure—with full presence and awareness, they will find most challenges are not
challenges at all, but opportunities to get a glimpse of the highest self. Every challenge they
successfully confront in life serves to strengthen their will, confidence and ability to conquer
future obstacles. Thirdly, cultivating the ability to meet challenges can prepare students
mentally for confronting adversity head-on. Once they’re ready for the worst, we believe
that no trauma will bring them down.
To conclude, developing the ability to confront challenges will benefit students in all
aspects of life.</code></pre>

necessary for them to strengthen a variety of competencies, the most important of which is
effective communication skills.
One of the main reasons is that delivering ideas straightforward and eliminating

network. Thus, better interpersonal relationships, resulting from the effective
communication skills, will lay a solid foundation for student learning. Another factor
contributing to the necessity of the skills is that students with clear words and gestures can
make new friends with ease. Last but not the least, those abilities must pave the way for
students’ careers in the future. Given that corporations need all-round talents,
communicating well with colleagues, customers and even bosses should be taken into

Encourage Students to Develop Effective Communication Skills
In today’s society, the importance of cultivating good communication skills cannot be
overstated. And students, as a member of society, it’s vital for them to develop effective
skills to communicate with others.
First of all, a person with effective communication skills finds it easier to put forth his
ideas clearly. In this way some misunderstanding can be effectively avoided, which helps to
develop better interpersonal relationships with people around him. Moreover, a good
communicator is often an excellent mediator and negotiator who is skilled in resolving
disputes and enhancing cooperation. Outstanding communication skills enable him to work
more effectively in groups and teams. Besides, effective communication skills are essential
to developing other key life skills like the problem-solving skill and the decision-making skill
that inevitably occur both in our private and professional lives.
There is a good saying that what communication does for an organization resembles
what the bloodstream does for an organism. Therefore, whether you’re an effective
communicator or not, it’s essential to understand the importance of good communication
and try to improve your communication skills.</code></pre>

attitude is to love what we do, just as the saying goes, &quot;What is worth doing is worth doing
well&quot;.
First of all, everything we do has its own value. If you think something you are doing is
useless, it is just that you haven&#39;t recognized its significance. Somethings, trivial and
unimportant as they may seem, can play a big role somewhere you haven&#39;t yet noticed, just
like the butterfly effects. So, we need to do our best in everything we do. Only in this way,
will no efforts be wasted. Secondly, finishing all tasks at our best brings ourselves extra
happiness. As we put our mind into what we are doing, we can find enjoyment and gain a
sense of fulfillment. So, doing what we are doing well can light our own lives.
&quot;What is worth doing is worth doing well&quot; is a wise quotation. It inspires us to have a

What Is Worth Doing Is Worth Doing Well
There is a famous saying, “What is worth doing is worth doing well”, which means if
you think something is worth doing, you should go all out to do it well.
First of all, on the issue of “what is worth doing”, people are bound to have different
views because of their different outlooks on life and values. When doing things, some
people only focus on the final result, while others pursue the harvest in the process. As for
me, if you believe that doing something will help you improve yourself to some extent, that’s
what’s worth doing. Secondly, once you decide to do something, you should do it well. If you
do things half-heartedly, not only will your chances of success be slim, but you won’t have
much sense of accomplishment even if you do succeed. Thirdly, doing things well is an
attitude to life which contributes to your personal development. Because once you make up
your mind to get things done well, you will try your best to learn new knowledge, which will
benefit you in the future even if you fail in the end.
Therefore, once you set out to do something, you should take it seriously, let alone do
something worth doing.</code></pre>

I strongly support this idea. There are two contributory reasons for my decision. Above
all, it can benefit our society in that it is the good qualities like integrity, honesty and warm
heart, which inner beauty boasts, that facilitate the development of the entire society.
Moreover, everyone should try to be kind and understanding. Without a kind heart, people
will grow indifferent and gradually they will make no contribution both to their family and to
the society. They will probably lead an empty life too.
From my perspective, it is crucial that modern education should encourage people to

ideas may differ from person to person. Among all the elements of beauty that modern
people attach importance to， I reckon that beauty of the soul is the essential beauty.
Looking around， we may find many facts which can reflect the value in the saying.
Take Lihong as an example, she is not the traditionally typical youngster who would be
considered beautiful. However, she keeps doing good routinely and insists in helping those
in need. When mentioned, Lihong is always the exemplary model praised by everybody. To
many acquaintances of hers， they think she is one of the most beautiful girls they&#39;ve ever
met. In the case of Lihong, beauty of the soul is more essentially valued than that of her
appearance.
To conclude， it is not the fashionable hairstyle， not the ex- pensive clothes we
wear， but beauty of our soul that determines how people see us. This reminds us again of
the value that beauty of the soul is the essential beauty.</code></pre>

Some claim that the nature of wealth is money related, not mind related. They focus on

this view might hold a bit of truth, wealth that can be lost is never the true wealth, and it is

Therefore, only those who make the most of the present are capable of achieving their goals

There is a famous saying that the best preparation for tomorrow is to do good work
today. Simple as the saying is, it informs us that one doesn&#39;t need to worry about the future
if he can seize the moment.

lt is generally believed that taking immediate action is of great importance. Doing good
work today enables people to achieve their great goals step by step. Assume a college
student who is indulged in his wishful thinking of passing the CET-6 exam with a high score
without any efforts and hardwork，and he will be devastated to accept the reality when he
fails. The same thing may be said of some grown-ups who aspire to gain fame and fortune
but never bother to put their splendid plans into practice immediately.

Therefore, by some means or other we must take action to pursue our goals. lt is
necessary for us to aim high but our behaviors should also deserve our dreams. We are
supposed to put our efforts into every single day and never look down upon those little
tasks. Only in this way can we fulfill our dreams.</code></pre>

Living in an age when the economy is rapidly developing and the commercial
environment becomes increasingly complicated, we have to realize that a sense of social
responsibility plays such an important role that it defines what we are and determines how
many accomplishments humans can achieve in the future. The reasons why sense of
social responsibility is so important can be listed as follows. On the one hand, a sense of
social responsibility can inherently restrain SS producers' behavior, which can
tremendously reduce the possibility of producing fake or even harmful commodities.
Without a sense of social responsibility, some producers might do great harm to the whole
society. Take Sanlu milk powder as an example. It was such an irresponsible enterprise that
it added tripolycyanamide to its milk powder, which tragically led to many babies'
developmental disorders and ruined many families' happiness. On the other hand, as a
member of the society, we should also be responsible for what we do to others as well as
the whole social environment As far as I'm concerned, a sense of social responsibility is to
our society what sunshine is to humans. Although we can survive for a while without
sunshine, but our healthy and long-lasting development can never shine without sun, just as
our society can never thrive without a sense of social responsibility.

The Importance of Having a Sense of Social Responsibility
As John Donne said, “No one is an island.” Human beings are social animals who live in
groups and work together. Because of this, the importance of having a sense of social
responsibility is fairly prominent.
For one thing, the sense of social responsibility will make us behave ourselves in the
public, which is helpful to build a harmonious society. For instance, those with a good sense
of social responsibility always pay attention to protecting the environment when they travel.
On the contrary, those who lack a sense of social responsibility always put their needs first
instead of public environment. For another, the sense of social responsibility is beneficial to
strengthening our social cohesion. For example, whenever a disaster occurs, a large number
of volunteers full of social responsibility devote themselves to the relief and reconstruction
work in disaster-affected areas, thereby the disaster-hit people overcome the difficulties
successfully.
All in all, as a member of society, if everyone has a good sense of social responsibility,
our society will certainly be better.

The Importance of Having a Sense of Community Responsibility
As every individual is a member of a specific group called the community, a sense of
community responsibility is a valuable quality that each of us should have.
The reasons are as follows. To begin with, having a good sense of community
responsibility is helpful to avoid disagreements among team members, promote teamwork
and improve work efficiency, which is particularly important in contemporary society.
Therefore, there is no modern enterprise that does not pay attention to cultivating the
collective consciousness of employees. Furthermore, people with a sense of community
responsibility are more likely to adhere to the rules and regulations set by their
communities, consciously conduct themselves politely and guard against such uncivilized
behavior as making a loud noise, casting peels and shells, smoking, and spitting, thus
contributing to promoting the establishment of a harmonious society.
In short, a good sense of community responsibility can motivate us to perfect the
communities where we live and work and promote the sustainability of our environment.</code></pre>

The Importance of Having a Sense of Family Responsibility
As far as I’m concerned, each of us, as a member of the family, must have a strong
sense of family responsibility.
For one thing, the sense of family responsibility is indispensable for maintaining a
harmonious family relationship and a stable marriage. A family member with a strong sense
of family responsibility always thinks for his family members, and gives warmth and care to
the people around him. When faced with problems and difficulties, he always has the
courage to take responsibility. For another, a person who fails to shoulder family
responsibilities is less likely to take on social responsibilities as well as collective
responsibilities, because family environment exerts a strong influence on the cultivation and
establishment of one’s character, and if one doesn’t have a sense of responsibility in a small
group like family, he will probably be in short of sense of responsibility when it comes to the
bigger ones, like companies and the whole society.
In brief, only with a high sense of family responsibility can a person have a happy family

Family is the most important unit of a society, and in Chinese culture, family has a
position that cannot be surpassed by any other social living units. Thus, it is of great
importance that every member in the family has a sense of family responsibility.
Inside a family, each member plays his or her different but essential role. Everyone,
including children, must bear family responsibility. Traditionally, men are often regarded as
the bread earners. Women are assigned to do housework and child-rearing work. With the
advancement of the society, more and more women are stepping into workplace, so it is
equally important for men to share household responsibilities. With both parents working a
nine-to-five job, it has also become a common phenomenon in China that grandparents
shoulder the responsibility of looking after small children. As for children, apart from
attending school, they should also be taught to help around the house.
Only in this way－each performs his or her own duty－can a family stick together and
become the bedrock of the society.</code></pre>

The Importance of Team Spirit and Communication
in the Workplace
As the saying goes, when teamwork kicks in, nobody can beat you. It highlights the
critical role that team spirit plays in completing a task. In my view, team spirit and
communication are especially important in the workplace.
First of all, with the increasingly fierce competition between enterprises, in order to
achieve the desired results, cooperation and communication among colleagues are
particularly important because they can maximize work efficiency. Secondly, promoting
team spirit and communication at work can ensure that everyone understands where the
company is going and get them all actively involved in the development of the company.
Thirdly, cooperation and communication at work can enhance the interaction between
coworkers and form good interpersonal relationships, which is essential to build a friendly,
cooperative, and harmonious working atmosphere in the enterprise culture.
To conclude, we cannot deny that it is almost always the joint efforts of a whole team
that decide the success or failure of a project. Therefore, for everyone in the workplace, we
should learn to cooperate and communicate effectively with team members, so as to
achieve a win-win situation.</code></pre>

your interpersonal relationships to a large extent. As mentioned above, if your respect

this way, can we earn the respect of others.
A saying goes that “respect others, and you will be respected”. Simple as the saying is,
its meaning is profound and thought-provoking. Evidently, it is meant to tell us that being
respected by others is derived from respecting others.
Actually, all men are born to be equal and respect or esteem is the basic need of men.
In other words, people cannot live freely and comfortably without others’ respect or esteem.
Taking a look around we can also find examples too many to enumerate. Don’t make a joke
with others, like appearance, social status, health conditions, since everyone has the right to
be respected as a member of the society. It is also a respectable behavior that there is no
interruption when others are talking or doing work. Without respect, it is hard for one to

from others when you are in a desperate situation. To drive my point home, I would like to
give an example of my classmate who is always ready to help others address various
problems about school assignments and everyday life. Unfortunately, his father was
diagnosed with a severe disease last year and the medical treatment almost exhausted all
their savings. After being told such bad news, almost all class members, generously and
voluntarily, donated money to him and offered as much help as we could.
In light of what has been argued so far, it is obvious that helping others is a traditional
Chinese virtue which we should carry forward through practical actions. As a result, as
college students--the backbone of our society--we are supposed to be a vanguard, striving
to create a social climate in which everyone helps and supports each other.

Be Generous with Your Help
When it comes to the topic of help, we are frequently told that, &quot;Help others, and you
will be helped when you are in need. &#39;&#39; Simple as the saying is, it implies the importance of
helping others in need. What I learn from the remark, in short words, is that helping others
is helping yourself.
Examples can easily be found to make this point clearer. The story of the ant and the
dove is a case in point. An ant slipped into the river when drinking along the river. A dove
heard his cries for help and threw him a leaf, which helped the ant float back to the bank.
After a few days, a hunter was raising his gun to the dove as she was building her nest.
Seeing this, the ant ran quickly to bite the hunter&#39;s leg. The dove heard the hunter&#39;s scream
and flew away.
All in all, this example indicates that when we offer our help to others, we are leaving a
way open for the future. Helping others is a virtue, and we should take some measures to
carry forward this virtue and do others a favor. Only in this way can we build a loving and
harmonious society.</code></pre>

A host of facts in our daily life have proved that lack of understanding is a critical factor
leading to disagreement among people, which makes it difficult for people to be on friendly
terms with others. That’s why the phrase “mutual understanding” is emphasized. Just as the
remark goes, “Seek to understand others, and you will be understood.”
The significance of mutual understanding cannot be underestimated. On the one hand,
mutual understanding serves as a prerequisite for learning progress, career success and
happy life. If we understand each other and are willing to reach agreement, we can be
empowered to summon multi-forces to grease the wheels of everything. On the other hand,
mutual understanding is the lubricant of human relations. For those who wish to build
lasting relationships and achieve civilized intercourse, mutual understanding is a foolproof
strategy.
To sum up, mutual understanding is the basis of our relationships with others and we
would be socially idiotic without it. To avoid this, all we need is our utmost effort to seek to
understand others.
【参考范文 3 】：
As is known to all, mutual understanding is the basis for a harmonious relationship.
Obviously, this simple yet thought-provoking saying that seek to understand others, and you
will be understood reminds us to learn to understand others in our daily life.
Why does mutual understanding matter a great deal in current society? It must be
admitted that seeking to understand others is beneficial to establishing a harmonious
interpersonal relationship and increasing our work efficiency. Take the workplace as an
example. If the executives seek to understand the actual needs of their employees and take
practical measures to meet the needs, the working atmosphere in the company will be
rather harmonious and enthusiastic, which will in turn contribute to a better performance of
the company. On the contrary, if these bosses know nothing and even do not care their
staff’s demands, it is impossible for all the workers to be united as one to promote the
advance of the company.
To put it in a nutshell, mutual understanding plays an indispensable role in the
establishment of a harmonious interpersonal relationship and a harmonious society at
large. As a result, as college students, we are supposed to seek to understand others in the
general routine of everyday living and in the future job market.</code></pre>

vary from person to person. Some see more benefits in studying at home while others claim
that studying abroad is a more ideal choice as it&#39;s more challenging. Personally, I am a

attending college abroad provides an opportunity to broaden one&#39;s experience and mind.
You can acquire cross-cultural experiences and gain new perspectives on your chosen field
of study. In addition, studying abroad helps you to polish your social skills; you can make
friends with different people with different background. Thirdly, overseas studying is
conducive to the formation of an independent, autonomous and tenacious personality,

Nowadays a lot of college graduates are faced with two options for their further
education: to study home or to study abroad. Some choose to stay home, while others
prefer the latter. If I were one of them, I would choose to study abroad.
First of all, studying abroad can broaden our horizons. When we study abroad, we can
make friends with people from different cultures and learn about other lifestyles. It will help
cultivate a global point of view, which is very important in this era. Secondly, studying
abroad can foster self-dependence. When we stay overseas, we have to rely on ourselves to
solve whatever problem we may encounter. Such self-dependence is beneficial to us in the
future.
There are many concerns about studying abroad, such as safety. However, if we take
proper precautions, we can ensure our safety. Therefore, after carefully weighing the

Nowadays, as the whole society place increasingly considerable value on education, the
question of whether to major in science or humanities at college is not only a concern for
students, but also a focal point for parents.
Some believe that to dig into science is a better choice because it promises us a brighter
future; others may hold the opposite view that humanity knowledge is the foundation of
humanity quality. As for me, both arguments are justified. However, I believe that the
important thing is not about which subject is better, what matters most is people who will
have to make the decision. In other words, we should not lay one-sided emphasis on the
advantages of either subject; on the contrary, the students themselves, their interests and
preferences, pros and cons are supposed to be taken into consideration. For example, if a
student is more adept at humanity and that’s where his real interests lie, then he should
dedicate to the study on humanity.

Science or Humanities
When pinched between majoring in science or humanities in college, many students
find themselves in a dilemma. Personally, the former is preferable for the following two
reasons.
Firstly, in a society where more importance is attached to material civilization, it is
natural to follow suit by majoring in science so that in the future, hopefully, one can make
great contribution in this aspect. As the very basis for spiritual enlightenment, material
development is closely knitted with academic studies of science. For example, the
innovation of daily appliances calls for mastery of basic theories of physics and chemistry.
The building of our residence requires architectural knowledge. Secondly, evidently, the
significance of humanities—the pearl of mankind knowledge—cannot be exaggerated too
much. However, students can accumulate it by cultivating themselves in a long run instead
of spending a few years studying it as a major. Since most subjects of humanities can be
attained along with our personal development, it is true that we should focus on the more
challenging knowledge at college—science.
All in all, both science and humanities have their distinctive luster. But in view of
practicality and difficulty, it is advisable that science be studied as a major in college.
【参考范文 3 】：
Nowadays, there has been a heated discussion as to the best choice in selecting the
major. Views on the topic vary greatly among people from different walks of life. Some
believe that it is a better choice to dig into the humanities, but others consider it better to

I totally agree with the former choice for the reasons presented below. Above all, it is
good for the whole society because if more people in this society can choose to dig into the
humanities,it is more likely that the society will become better and better. Also, it is good for
the person himself&#x2F;herself. For example, it can make him&#x2F;her more humanism rather than
more scientism, which will make him&#x2F;her a wiser person.
From my perspective, it is crucial that modern education should encourage people to be
wise meditators rather than mad scientists. Also it is crucial that people should understand
the meaning and value of humanities. Only in this way can we achieve greater success.

are as follow. In the first place, we should be conscious of the fact that both of the two
choices have its own superiorities. For instance, a vocational college specializes in cultivating
human resources with practical capabilities; while a university serves as the cradle of
academic researchers in different fields. Then it does follow that high school graduates

demerits and their choices must give play to their strengths whilst circumvent weaknesses.
In addition, interest is the best teacher and it&#39;s also the premise of learning on one&#39;s own

Vocational Education
Nowadays, whether joining a vocational college or a university becomes a hard choice
for many students. As for me, vocational education can be lucrative and fulfilling as well.
To begin with, there is an urgent call for skilled workers from the job market. Employers
often complain about the severe shortage of workers with expertise. In order to attract and
keep such talents, employers are willing to offer a handsome sum of salary. Therefore,
graduates from vocational colleges have a promising future in the monetary sense. In
addition, graduates from vocational colleges can be spiritually fulfilling too. The prejudice
against vocational training as the second-rank education is being modified. Whatever
degree a student gets, what counts most is the contribution he makes to the society. With
the specialties accumulated from vocational colleges along with their academic studies,
students can realize their value with the extra edge over university graduates who are
generally barren of practical skills.
All in all, it is crystal clear that vocational course is no longer inferior to university
degree. Rather, it fills a gap which college education is not necessarily covering when it

<pre class="language-none"><code class="language-none">Of all the elements that promote the development of our society, perhaps the most
far-reaching has been invention. It is difficult to the point of impossibility for people to
imagine a time without invention because it is the invention that enhances our society in all
aspects.
Invention indeed plays an essential role in our life. Had it not been for it, we could not
have lived in a modern society. Invention is momentous and fundamental to people what
the soul is vital and significant to us. Given this, what can we do to cultivate this precious
spirit?
The measures, to my mind, are listed as following. To begin with, the authorities
concerned should set up favorable laws and regulations to encourage invention. For
example, we can set up the practice of giving premiums to inventors. What is more, the
public are expected to realize the significance of invention, so that they can try their best to
invent things. Last but not least, the press should place more value on invention. Though
there is a long way to go, I firmly believe that our combined efforts will be rewarded at last.

My View on Invention
Drawing a comparison between modern life and ancient life, we cannot imagine what
life will be like now without invention. Invention must be attached great importance to, as it
is invention that contributes to the advancement of our society. There are several examples
which can be cited to illustrate this concept. I can think of no better illustration than the
following one. If Edison hadn&#39;t invented the light bulb, we would have lived a life as the blind
in the night.
Given that invention plays such an essential role in our life, what can we do to cultivate
this precious spirit? For one thing, it is advisable for the social media and publicity
department to vigorously inform the public of the importance of invention. For another, the
relevant authorities should set up favorable regulations to encourage invention. For
example, they can set up the practice of giving premiums or issuing patent certificate to
inventors.
Finally, I want to use the following saying as our mutual encouragement, “Invention is
the spirit of human being&#39;s progress. At no time should we underestimate the power of
invention. Therefore, when an idea comes to your mind, just make your own invention.</code></pre>

contact, we are becoming more socially awkward. The harm of replacing real-life contact
with virtual conversation, in my opinion, involves two aspects: it made us put on masks and
hold up shields. In a virtual world, we tend to create an image that rarely looks like us. We
post messages or pictures to show we are humorous, with a good taste, and living a
fabulous life. As a result, we fail to present our real self and dare not to be ourselves.
Another unpleasant thing about virtual conversation is that it encourages unimaginable
violence of language. The Internet has become a shield in many ways， exempting us from
the consequence we should take responsibility for even though we make dreadful and
malicious comments sometimes. This undoubtedly mins the quality of social interaction that
we need as human beings. All in all, if we spend too much time interacting virtually, we will
dedicate little effort to real-world bonding. Consequently, our interpersonal relationship
weakens gradually, and we will end up with unprecedented alienation.

My View on Living in the Virtual World
With the rapid development of our modern society, it has been made possible to live
in the virtual world. Have you ever imagined what will happen when people prefer to live in
the virtual world rather than interact in the real world?
Undoubtedly, the Internet has brought us many benefits. It enriches our life for its
wonderful activities and broadens our horizons because of its huge information. However, if
we spend more and more time in the virtual world, some negative impacts will be imposed
on our life. First and foremost, if we are addicted to the virtual world, we will lose much time
to interact with others face to face. If the Internet disappears from our life one day, we will
be puzzled at how to face our family members and friends. In addition, spending too much
time in the virtual world, we will be increasingly indifferent and cold blooded, which will do
great harm to the maintenance of our interpersonal relationships.
To sum up, if we want to enjoy our life and continue our interpersonal relationships,
we should use the Internet properly and never allow it to alienate us from the real world.</code></pre>

For one thing, more people can access high-quality courses globally, such as Harvard
free online courses. Therefore, even rural people will also get access to abundant and
updated knowledge. For another, people can decide when and where they take the online
courses much more freely. Thus they will no longer be bothered by problems like
transportation and accommodation. As a result, learning cost will be so largely decreased
that people can afford to apply for more courses they are interested in.
However, for people who have bad self-discipline and learning habits, it is difficult to
commit themselves to study. They will fall behind and actually learn little since nobody
supervises them. What&#39;s worse, e-learning can&#39;t offer human interaction in real life. It is due
to the lack of face-to-face interaction with teachers and classmates that people will feel
isolated and gradually lose basic social skills.
To sum up, that more people turn to e-learning will have both advantages and

With science and technology developing, an increasing number of people prefer to take
courses and acquire knowledge online rather than attend school, causing e-learning
booming all around the world. What will happen if e-learning prevails and even replaces
classroom learning?
There&#39;s no doubt that e-learning may give us some benefits. For one thing, learners can
acquire knowledge regardless of time and locations. People around us often complain that
they are too busy to study or the classroom is so far that they are reluctant or unable to
study. With e-learning, they have no excuse to escape. For another thing, learners can be
armed with the updated information through online learning. Just by clicking the mouse,
you can get any information that you need in no time.
Admittedly, e-learning can offer us many advantages and make our life more
convenient and efficient; however, e-learning is inappropriate to people who lack self-
discipline. They may probably just idle their time away on the Internet. Moreover, with so
much useless and false information on the Internet, chances are that we may get confused.
To sum up, e-learning has advantages and disadvantages. It is advisable for us to
balance the relationship between e-learning and attending school.</code></pre>

There is no doubt that human society is benefiting tremendously from robots. On the

The progression of technology is inevitable and undeniable,which makes the intelligent

happen to our work and life?
From my point of view, in the near future, our work in industry will be operated by
robots, which will raise productivity and lower costs of manpower. What&#39;s more, our
cooking, washing and cleaning in daily life will be complete d by robot servers, which will
liberate us from trivial housework, and give us more time to do things we like. However,
there is still much real challenge if robots become the mainstream of society. First, the less-
skilled people will be out of work as a result of the wide application of robots in industry.
Second, we will get lazier and lazier with robots doing housework instead of us.
Based on the above imagination, we can easily acknowledge that the robot is a double-
edged sword. We should draw on the advantages and avoid disadvantages, and make it
bring maximum benefits to human beings.</code></pre>
